## Dev

First time you clone the repo, make sure to create the python environment with all the dependencies. In root, run `poetry install`. To drop into the shell of that environment, run `poetry shell`.

## Contributing

Make sure you are running the dev in `poetry` environment. You need to manage the dependencies correctly. No PR will be merged unless all the deps are included with `poetry`.
